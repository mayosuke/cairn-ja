## Print to Order
- A print on demand version is available on [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/yochai-gal-and-cosmic-orrery-and-jim-parkin/cairn/paperback/product-q7jgg7.html), [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/330809/Cairn), and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1329489020). The price is _at cost_.
- The Lulu version is slightly nicer than the other PoD options, and they are a cool company. Support them if you can.
- There is also a PoD [coil bound](https://www.lulu.com/shop/yochai-gal-and-cosmic-orrery-and-jim-parkin/cairn-coilbound/paperback/product-gm9e8g.html) edition available on Lulu. It "lies flat" at the table!
